# this link doesn't work anymore (on purpose)

this isn't your typical 404 page as I can explain why you were (probably) redirected here.

in a move to being less online (for reasons I shall not disclose here), I decided to delete, private or archive certain platforms I was or am on.

## discord

discord is privacy-invasive and otherwise full of shit. I left a good chunk of Discord servers and moved DMs and stuff to [Signal](https://signal.org/).

as for my own server, it is now friends/acquaintances-only. If you are a friend of mine, please request access (send me [an email](mailto:clembs@clembs.com) if you don't have me for some reason).

## youtube

youtube is owned by multi-billion dollar corporation google, a well-known data behemoth. recently they rolled out ai age verification which severely hurts the right to privacy and freedom of speech. theyve been going out against independant creators, censoring, demonetizing, the works.

i did not make much content on the platform anyway, so it shouldn't matter all to much.

## twitch

i do not stream on twitch very often anymore. my Super Smash Bros. gaming club hosts tournaments streamed there from time to time, please [check it out](https://twitch.tv/pnsgg) if you understand french.

## other links

i probably don't use the platform you were trying to see me on. sorry

## state of the centralized internet

to be frank, the internet is getting more and more shit. for the past 10 years we've seen every big website being [enshittified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), ai slop taking over search results, corporate greed and whatnot.

for some time now, ive been moving off google services, moving to Linux, using privacy-focused alternatives and even self-hosting my own services recently (i might blog about this).

what im getting at is, clembs.com is the only source of truth for my content, thoughts and whatnot. the less we use big tech, the more it actually hurts them to become better. this website is now fully autonomous, doesnt require third party scripts or fonts and is hosted for free on my homelab.

i dont think having instagram, tiktok or linkedin should really be a requirement. theyre made to be addictive and harmful. personal websites on the other end are... personal, customized, FUN! so that's the way i'll vibe for now â˜•

if you read all this, thank you very much! please send me your thoughts about this whole debacle [via email](mailto:clembs@clembs.com)!
